## üõ°Ô∏è Safety System

Smart-Shell includes a comprehensive safety system to protect users from potentially harmful commands.

### Safety Levels
- **Safe** üü¢: Commands that are considered safe
- **Warning** üü°: Might have unintended consequences (requires confirmation)
- **Blocked** üî¥: Potentially harmful (will not be executed)

### Safety Checks
- **Blocked Commands:** Explicitly blocks dangerous commands (e.g., `rm -rf /`, fork bombs, disk formatting)
- **Pattern Matching:** Uses regex to identify risky command patterns (e.g., `sudo`, `rm -rf`)
- **Path Analysis:** Detects operations on sensitive system paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`)
