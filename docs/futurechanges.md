# Future Changes - Smart-Shell v1.1.0

This document outlines the major features and improvements planned for Smart-Shell v1.1.0, focusing on enhanced privacy, offline capabilities, and advanced multi-command execution.

## 🚀 Release Target: v1.1.0

The following features represent a significant evolution of Smart-Shell's core architecture, introducing privacy-first design and advanced command execution capabilities.

---

## 🚫 Offline Mode (Zero Cloud Dependency)

### Overview

Smart-Shell v1.1.0 introduces **Offline Mode**, allowing users to leverage Smart-Shell's capabilities without sending any data to cloud APIs like Google Gemini.

### Why Offline Mode?

- **Maximum Privacy**: No terminal output or prompt logs reach external servers
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Meets strict data governance requirements
- **Network Independence**: Works without internet connectivity
- **Cost Control**: No API usage costs for offline operations

### Architecture

```text
[User Input] 
    ↓
[Local NLP / LLM (Ollama, LM Studio, GGUF, etc)]
    ↓
[Command Generator]
    ↓
[Safety System (Layered Classifier)]
    ↓
[Execution / Dry Run / Confirmation]
```

### Supported Local LLM Backends

#### Current & Planned Integrations

- ✅ **Ollama** with models like `phi`, `codellama`, `mistral`
- ✅ **LM Studio** (via REST API)
- 🔄 **Planned**: `ggml`, `llamacpp`, custom-trained distilled models

### Configuration

#### Interactive Setup

```bash
smart-shell setup
# Choose: Local Model
# Specify: Ollama / LM Studio / Other
```

#### Configuration File

```toml
# ~/.config/smart-shell/config.toml
llm_mode = "offline"
model_backend = "ollama"
model_name = "codellama"
offline_model_url = "http://localhost:11434"  # Ollama default
```

### Benefits

- 🔐 **Complete Privacy**: No data leaves your machine
- ⚡ **Low Latency**: Direct local model inference
- 💰 **Cost-Free**: No API charges
- 🌐 **Offline Capable**: Works without internet

## 🔁 Safe Continuous REPL Mode

### Problem Statement

Many tasks require multiple command steps that depend on each other:

- Example: "Set up nginx and start server"
- Each step might depend on the output of the previous step
- Sending multiple terminal outputs to cloud LLMs creates privacy risks

### Smart-Shell's Solution

**Safety-Aware, Output-Controlled Multi-Step Execution**

### Key Features

- ✅ **Command Execution Plan** generation from a single natural prompt
- ✅ **4-tier Safety Classification** for each step
- ✅ **Privacy Protection**: No logs or raw output sent to LLM
- ✅ **Context-Safe Summaries**: Only sanitized summaries used for context

### Execution Flowchart

```text
[User Prompt]
    ↓
[LLM (Offline or Online)] → Generates plan of steps
    ↓
[SmartShell Execution Engine]
    For each step:
        - Classify command (Safe, Info_Leak, Medium, High)
        - Ask for confirmation if needed
        - Execute (or dry run)
        - Summarize result (NOT full logs)
    ↓
If next command depends on prior:
    - Gemini: only summary is sent
    - Offline: full control
    ↓
[Loop Until Complete / Canceled]
```

### Command Risk Classification

| Risk Level | Behavior | Examples |
|------------|----------|----------|
| ✅ **Safe** | Executed automatically | `ls`, `pwd`, `echo` |
| 🔵 **Info Leak** | Confirmation required | `env`, `cat .bashrc`, `ps aux` |
| 🟡 **Medium** | sudo or system-altering → y/n required | `sudo apt install`, `systemctl start` |
| 🔴 **High** | Dangerous → extra warning + confirm | `rm -rf`, `mkfs`, `dd` |

### Privacy by Design

#### Data Never Sent to LLM (Online Mode)

- ❌ Terminal environment variables
- ❌ Raw command output
- ❌ File content
- ❌ stdout/stderr logs
- ❌ System information

#### Instead, Only Safe Summaries

- ✅ "Previous step: sudo apt install nginx — status: success"
- ✅ "Directory creation: completed"
- ✅ "Service status: running"
