# Safety

Smart-Shell includes a comprehensive safety system to protect users from potentially harmful commands.

## Safety Levels

- **Safe** ðŸŸ¢: Commands that are considered safe to run (executed automatically)
- **Medium** ðŸŸ¡: Commands that might have consequences like sudo operations (requires y/n confirmation)
- **High** ðŸ”´: Commands that are potentially dangerous like file deletion (requires y/n confirmation)
- **Info Leak** ðŸ”µ: Commands that might expose sensitive information (requires confirmation)

## Safety Checks

- **Risk Assessment:** All commands are analyzed for potential risks before execution
- **Pattern Matching:** Uses regex to identify risky command patterns (e.g., `sudo`, `rm -rf`, `dd`, `chmod 777`)
- **Path Analysis:** Detects operations on sensitive system paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, system directories)
- **User Confirmation:** Medium and high-risk commands require explicit y/n confirmation
- **Command Editing:** Users can edit blocked commands before execution

## Confirmation System

- All confirmations accept `y`/`yes` or `n`/`no` (case insensitive)
- Users maintain full control - even high-risk commands can be executed with confirmation
- Clear explanations are provided for why commands are flagged

> **Note:** The safety system is designed to inform and protect, not restrict. Users have final control over command execution after being informed of potential risks.
